One of the questions that many Muslims have is how to recite du'a after namaz. There are different opinions among the scholars about the best way and time to make du'a, but there are some general guidelines that can be followed.
 
## How to recite du'a after namaz
 
First of all, it is important to understand that du'a is an act of worship that should be done sincerely and humbly, with full trust and reliance on Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Du'a is worship.\" (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2969; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi). Therefore, one should avoid making du'a for anything that is unlawful, harmful, or frivolous. One should also avoid making du'a with a loud voice or in a way that disturbs others.
 
Secondly, it is recommended to make du'a after namaz while facing the qiblah (the direction of the Ka'bah in Makkah) and raising one's hands to the level of the chest or shoulders. One should also wipe one's face with one's hands after finishing the du'a, as this was reported from some of the companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with them).
 
Thirdly, it is preferable to start the du'a with praising Allah and sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as this is more likely to make the du'a accepted. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Every du'a is kept back until you send blessings upon the Prophet.\" (Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat, 1/220; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami', 4399). One should also end the du'a with saying aameen (O Allah, accept it), as this is a way of affirming one's request.
 
Fourthly, it is advisable to make du'a after namaz using the words and phrases that are taught by the Quran and the Sunnah, as they are more comprehensive and eloquent than our own words. There are many du'as that are reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) that can be recited after namaz, such as:

- Astaghfirullah (I seek forgiveness from Allah) three times.
- Allahumma antas salamu wa minkas salamu tabarakta ya zaljalaali wal-ikram (O Allah, You are Peace and from You comes peace. Blessed are You, O Possessor of majesty and honor) once.
- Huwa Allahu al-raheem (He is Allah, the Most Merciful) seven times.
- Ayatul Kursi (the verse of the throne) once.
- Tasbeeh-e-Fatima (the glorification of Fatima) once.
- La ilaha illa Allahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala-kulli-shay'in qadeerun (There is no god but Allah alone, He has no partners, to Him belongs dominion and to Him belongs praises, and He has power over all things) once.
- Rabbana atina fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasanatan waqina adhaban-nar (Our Lord, give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire) once.
- Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min al-hammi wal-hazani wa a'udhu bika min al-'ajzi wal-kasali wa a'udhu bika min al-jubni wal-bukhli wa a'udhu bika min ghalabat id-dayni wa qahr ir-rijal (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from anxiety and sorrow, and I seek refuge in You from weakness and laziness, and I seek refuge in You from cowardice and miserliness, and I seek refuge in You from being overcome by debt and being overpowered by 0f148eb4a0
